### Questions: 
What are the trends in the US industry? What can recent graduates anticipate in terms of employment trajectories within these industries? 

### Introduction
The current IPUMS USA dataset includes samples from 2008 - 2022 and incorporates the variables occupations (“OCC”), industry (“IND”), educational attainment (“EDUC”) and income (“INCTOT”). These variables are key to discovering key economic trends and labor market changes in the American population.   
Leveraging the dataset, the analysis seeks to delineate patterns in various US industries, shedding light on the economic landscape that new graduates will enter.

### Conclusion
Based on our analysis, industries poised for substantial growth include mining and information technology. Meanwhile, industries showing the most significant income growth are internet software and financial investment. Finally, when considering occupations with the highest income potential, individuals with a college degree excel in information-related professions, while those without degrees often find lucrative opportunities as electricians.
